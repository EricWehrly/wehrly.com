    Meet Jason, our emcee. 
    Jason is Monica's coolest cousin. 
    He's basically a walking party, like the old '80's stereotype of a guy in shorts and sunglasses carrying his boombox into any situation. 
    Only his boombox is a bluetooth speaker and the music is about a decade more recent.
    When he's not emcee'ing a party, Jason can be found helping the elderly (with their dialysis) and shopping at Target.
