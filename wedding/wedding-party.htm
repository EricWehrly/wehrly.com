        <pre style="background-image: url('./img/boombox.jpg');">
    Meet Jason, our emcee. 
    Jason is Monica's coolest cousin. 
    He's basically a walking party, like the old '80's stereotype of a guy in shorts and sunglasses carrying his boombox into any situation. 
    Only his boombox is a bluetooth speaker and the music is about a decade more recent.
    When he's not emcee'ing a party, Jason can be found helping the elderly (with their dialysis) and shopping at Target.
        </pre>

            <pre>
            <!-- approved üëç -->
    Meet Serena, the maid of honor.
    Serena is Monica's big sister. From Delta Phi Lambda at Georgia Tech.
    Go jackets! üêù
    Serena is the best chef in the world and shares Monica's sense of humor; as well as a profound love of cats, dogs, and derrieres thereof. 
        </pre>
            <pre style="background-image: url('./img/randall.jpg');">
            <!-- approved but revised -->
    Meet Randall, the best man.
    Randall is so because he is the most honest, dependable person that Eric knows.
    Above a prominent door frame in his home read the words "Always Be Humble and Kind", a touch from his Mother's decoration.
    This speaks at it's core to the way that Randall was raised, and the way in which Randall conducts himself.
    Randall strives to be up to date on all the trendiest movies, shows, anime, and memes.
    As such, part of his official job function is as team meme lord.
        </pre>
            <pre style="background-image: url('./img/woori.jpg');">
            <!-- approved üëç -->
    Meet Woori ("whootie"), our first bridesmaid.
    And you probably will, since she's such a wonderfully social person.
    Woori is Monica's best friend.
    She charms basically everyone that she meets with her sharp wit, warm attitude, and pleasant charisma.
    Y'all don't wear her out. She's a treasure.
        </pre>
            <pre style="background-image: url('./img/darrell.jpg');">
            <!-- approved üëç -->
    Meet Darrell, our first groomsman.
    Darrell is Eric's best friend.
    They first met in college,
        becoming such good friends that they would later live together
        when first embarking on their journey as software developers.

    Darrell is the extrovert to Eric's introvert.
    He has the ability to strike up a conversation with anyone, in virtually any situation, no matter how dangerous or strange.
    Darrell retreats into his cave to hibernate for the entirety of football season, sometimes as early as the pre-season.
    The college football draft serves a reminder of the impending hibernation cycle of the North American Darrell.

    Darrell is also the link through which Eric met many of his friends, both in attendance and otherwise.

    [image of Hannah]
    Meet our next bridesmaid, Hannah.
    During the pandemic, Hannah and Monica lived together with Andrew, Monica's brother, where they fostered many kittens and puppies. 
    She is family now.
    Hannah is an enthusiastic yelper,
    a yoga instructor,
    and works in healthcare analytics. 
    She likes fitness, animals, and Andrew's shennanigans.

                <!-- approved but revised -->
    Meet our next groomsman, Allison
    Allison is Eric's longest friendship.
    The two met in high school, where Allie was a military brat, and Eric was often assumed to be.
    Their mutual appreciation of nerd stuff, mainly the same kinds of video games, drew Eric and Allison together.
    They lived as college roommates with their friend Jason, who probably rode off into a sunset.
    Despite varying distances, Allison and Eric stay in touch, occasionally getting sucked into one or another game together.

    Allison must routinely bulwark bookshelves that are overburdened, mostly by manga.
    She's a fan of curries, despite her family's aversion; and lived for a time in Japan, without liking sushi :/
        </pre>
            <pre style="background-image: url('./img/jess.png');">
            <!-- approved üëç -->
    Meet Jessica, our next bridesmaid.
    Jess is the absolute rock among Monica's cousins. 
    She is the person to go to in difficult times, as well as easy,
    when you need someone to have your back, 
    or just need to get the family to plan a vacation together.

    Jessica is also one of the friendliest, most positive people that you will ever meet
    who will also leap across this counter and disarm your ass. Do not try her. We have the tapes to prove it.
    She's a fan of Sanrio and karaoke,
        and has a babysitter for her son so don't let her use that to stop you from roping her into shenanigans.
        </pre>
            <pre>
    Meet our next groomsman, Raz!
    Rounding out the nerd huddle, Raz is a technologist who constantly works to improve quality of life for himself and those he cares for.
    He is kind, and thoughtful, fond of tinkering, philosophy, and food adventures. He has a wide range of interests, and endeavors at new hobbies regularly.
    Raz also seems to make friends every place he goes, which is quite dynamic in that range of interests.
    He is normally very articulate, but perhaps his most striking quality is when that articulation emerges with a thorough, thoughtful take on the current discussion.
