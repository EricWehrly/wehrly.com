        <div class="wedding-party">
        <pre>
            [image of Jason]
    Meet Jason, our emcee. 
    Jason is Monica's coolest cousin. 
    He's basically a walking party, like the old '80's stereotype of a guy in shorts and sunglasses carrying his boombox into any situation. 
    Only his boombox is a bluetooth speaker and the music is about a decade more recent.
    When he's not emcee'ing a party, Jason can be found helping the elderly (with their dialysis) and shopping at Target.
        </pre>
        <pre>
    [image of Serena]
    Meet Serena, the maid of honor.
    Serena is Monica's <s>coolest cousin</s> <s>best friend</s> big sister. From Delta Phi Lambda at Georgia Tech.
    Go jackets! üêù
    Serena is the best chef in the world and shares Monica's profound love of cats, as well as the fresher aspects of their sense of humor.

    Sorry, fellas. Serena joins us this afternoon accompanied by her loving boyfriend, Chris/Dad.
    <!-- I just wanted to make the chris/dad joke but don't think it's actually a good idea to mention attachment-->
        </pre>
        <pre><img src="./img/randall.jpg" />
    Meet Randall, the best man.
    Randall is so because he is the most honest, dependable person that Eric knows.
    Above a prominent door frame in his home read the words "Always Be Humble and Kind", a touch from his Mother's decoration.
    This speaks at it's core to the way that Randall was raised, and the way in which Randall conducts himself.
    Randall will be up to date on all the trendiest anime and shows.
        </pre>
        <pre>

    Meet Woori ("whootie"), our first bridesmaid.
    Woori is Monica's best friend.
    And you probably will, since she's such a wonderfully social person.
    Woori charms basically everyone that she meets with her sharp wit, warm attitude, and pleasant charisma. 
    Sometimes, when standing next to Woori, we can't help but think that we are just worse people.
        </pre>
        <pre><img src="./img/darrell.jpg" />
    Meet Darrell, our first groomsman.
    Darrell is Eric's best friend.
    They first met in college,
        becoming such good friends that they would later live together
        when first embarking on their journey as software developers.

    Darrell is the extrovert to Eric's introvert.
    He has the ability to strike up a conversation with anyone, in virtually any situation, no matter how dangerous or strange.
    Unless they're a dauntingly pretty woman.
    Darrell retreats into his cave to hibernate for the entirety of football season, sometimes as early as the pre-season.
    The college football draft serves a reminder of the impending hibernation cycle of the North American Darrell.
    He misses his old Chevrolet Avalanche with every passing car ride.
        </pre>
        <pre>
    Meet our next bridesmaid, Hannah.
    Hannah and Monica lived together, for a time, back when <i>Monica's brother, Andrew, proposed to his then-girlfriend.</i>
    She family now.
    Hannah is a highly influencial food critic,
    a yoga instructor,
    and a big data engineer.
    She likes fitness, animals, and Andrew's shennanigans.
        </pre>
        <pre>
    Meet our next groomsman, Allison
    Allison is Eric's longest friendship.
    The two met in high school, where Allie was a military brat, and Eric was often assumed to be.
    They did that nerd stuff, and eventually spent time doing nerd stuff together, as friends do.
    Eric and Allison lived together in college with their friend Jason, who probably rode off into a sunset.
    Occasionally, they still hop online and do nerd stuff.

    Allison generally likes all of the nerd stuff.
    I apologize for being boringly generic here, but y'all know Eric is writing this, right? 
    I could list some things, but I don't know how else to avoid being here all night.
    It's like video games and anime and stuff. You know, the usual.
        </pre>
        <pre>
    Meet Jessica, our next bridesmaid.
    Jessica is Monica's best cousin.
    Jess is the absolute rock among the cousins. 
    She is the person to go to in difficult times, as well as easy,
    when you need someone to have your back, 
    or just need to get the family to plan a vacation together
    she's your gal.

    Jessica is also one of the friendliest, positive people you will ever meet
    who will also leap across this counter and disarm your ass. Do not try her. We have the tapes to prove it.
    She's a big fan of trivia, and karaoke,
        and has a babysitter for her son so don't let her use that to stop you from roping her into shennanigans.
        </pre>
        <pre>
    Meet our next groomsman, Raz!
    Raz is Eric's coolest friend. Seriously. He's probably the flyest looking dude at the wedding.
    Rounding out the nerd huddle, Raz is a technologist who constantly works to improve quality of life for himself and those he cares for.
    Raz is kind, thoughtful, and articulate beyond any reasonable measure.
